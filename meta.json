  "description": "The Law of Heaven states: Giving and receiving are the same. The old world, a world built on separation, exploitation, selfishness, lies and enslavement is crumbling. We carry the light, and the light casts away all shadows. We will create a new world in our image and likeness, we  will create a new world founded upon unity, cooperation, kindness, truth, freedom, and most of all love. We are the harbingers of this new age. Join me, my brothers, together, and only together will we waken from this dream of fear into dreams of happiness, love and joy. And leading finally beyond all dreams, unto the peace of everlasting life.",
